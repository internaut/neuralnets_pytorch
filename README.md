# Neural Network from scratch in PyTorch

November 2022 / Markus Konrad <post@mkonrad.net>

## Description

Contains two "from scratch" machine learning example implementations originally found in *Deep Learning with Python* by Fran√ßois Chollet but adapted to PyTorch:

- `linear_classif_from_scratch.py` implements a simple linear model used for binary classification in 2D  space on synthetic data
- `nn_from_scratch.py` implements a simple two-layer sequential neural network that is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset

All examples use only "basic" torch functions and auto-grad.
