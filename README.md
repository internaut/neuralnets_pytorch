# Neural Network from Scratch in PyTorch

November 2022 / Markus Konrad <post@mkonrad.net>

## Description

A showcase example that implements a simple two-layer sequential neural network that is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset and uses only "basic" torch functions and auto-grad. Roughly follows the TensorFlow example implementation in *Deep Learning with Python* by Fran√ßois Chollet, but adapts it to PyTorch.
