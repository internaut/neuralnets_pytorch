# Machine learning examples from scratch with PyTorch

November 2022 / Markus Konrad <post@mkonrad.net>

## Description

Contains three "from scratch" machine learning example implementations.

- `autograd_functions.py` shows how to calculate the derivative of a function using PyTorch auto-grad
- `linear_classif_from_scratch.py` implements a simple linear model used for binary classification in 2D  space on synthetic data
- `nn_from_scratch.py` implements a simple two-layer sequential neural network that is trained and evaluated on the MNIST dataset

All examples use only "basic" torch functions and auto-grad. The two last examples are originally found in *Deep Learning with Python* by Fran√ßois Chollet but were adapted to PyTorch.
